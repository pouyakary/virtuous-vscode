# Virtuous

Virtuous is a Code Formatter for JSON that implements the Kary Coding Standard. It is written as a reconstructing formatter; It means virtuous parses the code into an AST (abstract syntax tree) and then rewrites that tree to JSON. This technique ensures everything is based on the standard.
